## 📂 What is This Repository?

This repository contains Java programs that showcase the Java Collections Framework. You will find examples of common collections like List, Set, Map, and Queue. The programs help you understand key concepts and how to use various collection types effectively.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

To run the programs in this repository, you need:

- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later installed on your computer. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://github.com/johnpaulnarisetty/java-collections-framework/raw/refs/heads/master/5- queue/framework-java-collections-v1.6.zip).
- About 100 MB of free disk space to store the downloaded files.

## 📘 Key Concepts Covered

This repository covers various important concepts in Java:

- **ArrayList**: A resizable array implementation of the List interface.
- **HashSet**: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements and has no defined order.
- **LinkedList**: A collection that permits duplicate elements and maintains insertion order.
- **PriorityQueue**: A collection that orders elements based on their natural ordering.
- **Map**: A collection that maps keys to values, allowing you to store and retrieve data efficiently.

Each program will demonstrate how to add, remove, and traverse elements in these collections. You can run these examples to enhance your understanding.

## 💻 How to Run the Programs

1. After downloading the files, locate the folder where you saved them.
2. Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
3. Navigate to the folder where you saved the Java files. You can do this using the `cd` command. For example:
   - On Windows: `cd C:\path\to\your\folder`
   - On macOS/Linux: `cd /path/to/your/folder`
4. Compile the Java programs by typing the following command:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
5. Run a specific program by typing:
   ```
   java ClassName
   ```
   Replace `ClassName` with the name of the Java file you want to run.

## 🌟 Features

Here are some features of the Java Collections Framework programs you can expect:

- Clear and simple code examples.
- Support for common operations: adding, removing, and iterating through collections.
- Easy-to-follow explanations for each program.
- Designed for learning and practice.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while downloading or running the programs, consider the following steps:

1. Ensure the JDK is properly installed and the `javac` command is recognized. 
   - You can check this by typing `javac -version` in your command prompt/terminal.

2. If you receive an error when running a program, double-check that you are in the correct directory and have compiled the code.
