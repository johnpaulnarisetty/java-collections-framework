## 📌 Overview

This repository represents my **step-by-step, hands-on practice of the Java Collections Framework**, structured intentionally to cover **each concept in a logical learning order**.

The primary objective is to:
- Practice Java Collections **deeply and consistently**
- Cover the **entire framework from fundamentals to practical usage**
- Maintain a **clean, readable, and well-organized codebase**
- Showcase **structured thinking and learning discipline**

While this repository is built from a **personal practice perspective**, it is also structured in a way that **others can learn from the code and organization**.
